Game Pitch

Your pitch must include:
I would like to create a game called "Fifteen Puzzle"
I played it when was a teenager and thought it would be cool to programm it.
For this project I will need to use JavaScript, HTML, and probably vanilla CSS (wondering what is the difference between, CSS3 and vanilla CSS and/or regular CSS.


Wireframes of your game

This is a creenshot of a sample similar game.


MVP Goals
1 Step. To Get Basic JS functionality together with HTML.
to have a game board to click on a piece and have it move.
event listener and trigger that to move peieces on the board.

Pseudocode:
1. Upon entering the window/screen - all of the objects are created and loaded. 
2. Objects: board, 1-15 numbered square/round pieces, start game button, reset button, moves tracker board and time ticker board.
3. Game flow: Upon page load - Board starts out solved then --> plyer clicks on Start Game button --> pieces shuffle --> player starts clicking on the pieces --> trigers piece to move to the free space. When player solves the puzzle = lines up all pieces in numerical order (Does it matter if it is right to left or left to right?) game stops and message is triggered 




Stretch Goals
2 Step. Use CSS to make it more UI friendly.

Any potential roadblocks
JS!!!!!!!!! :-)
